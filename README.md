# Smart Grid

In the evolving landscape of energy management, the integration of renewable energy sources with advanced grid systems presents a significant opportunity to enhance efficiency and sustainability. Our project aims to develop a cutting-edge smart grid system that leverages machine learning and optimization algorithms to predict and manage energy trading with an external grid. This system will incorporate an internal solar array to harness renewable energy and make real-time decisions on energy storage, usage, selling, and buying.

The smart grid model will simulate a single day with each minute represented by a 5-minute interval, allowing for detailed analysis and optimization of energy flows. The system will be equipped with six microcontrollers: three dedicated to managing load usage and three connected to a Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) module that governs the energy flow decisions. By utilizing predictive analytics and an optimization framework, our smart grid will aim to maximize economic and energy efficiency while minimizing reliance on external energy sources.

Key components of the project include:

- **Internal Solar Array:** A renewable energy source that will provide power for the grid.
- **Machine Learning Predictive Models:** To forecast energy production and consumption patterns.
- **Optimization Algorithms:** To make informed decisions on whether to store energy, use it, sell it back to the grid, or purchase additional energy.
- **Microcontroller Management:** Six microcontrollers with distinct rolesâ€”three for load management and three for energy flow control via the SMPS module.


This project not only addresses the current challenges of energy management but also sets the stage for future advancements in smart grid technologies. By implementing this model, we aim to demonstrate the potential for intelligent, data-driven energy systems to revolutionize how energy is produced, distributed, and consumed.
